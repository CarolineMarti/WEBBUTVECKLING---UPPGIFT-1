                            Hi I`m Caroline, a Norwegian student studying UX
                            Design and Requirements Management in Stockholm.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            I have been searching for the perfect job for
                            several years without finding the right fit.
                            Generally, I am creative and enjoy trying new things
                            and helping others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, after studying media studies, social studies,
                            and working as a makeup artist and security guard
                            for a while, I discovered Ux Design and I was
                            instantly captivated. I can be creative, help
                            people, and also nerd out on individual projects as
                            well as work in groups. PERFECT! As of now, I have
                            taken courses such as Introduction to IT,
                            Interaction Design, Requirements Management, Web
                            Development, and now I will start User Experience
                            with new technologies course. The projects I have
                            worked on in my spare time and those we have had at
                            school will be posted here.
